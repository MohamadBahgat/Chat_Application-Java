# Chat_Application-Java (Worked in it alone)
This is full chat application, full functions Client-Server and Multi-users using Socket Programming, with GUI in java.

There are two zipped folders one with sound features and one without sound features as there are some new versions in eclipse does not allow anymore using some old libraries.

# One more tip:

I recommend using Eclipse instead of Netbeans in this project. It will work with you very fine, just import the project normally and have fun :D.

# It contains the following features:

1) Applicable for multi-users.
2) Public chat.
3) Private chat with a specific person.
4) Allows you to know who is online.
5) Notification about who came online and who went off.
6) Sound notifications for some features in it.
7) Simple, comfortable, Perfect GUI.
